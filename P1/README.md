# Project 1

## Description

My goal was to create an experience builder website for a business of my choosing, and also create a single page LWC application, apex classes, and triggers for that business.
In my case, I created a baseball company.

## Tenchnologies Used
1. JavaScript -LWC
2. HTML -LWC
3. Apex -Triggers, Helper Classes.

## Features
1. LWC application that holds many different LDS forms for both submitting, and viewing previously submitted information.
2. Triggers for my baseball company. Including triggers that make better usernames for a user that signs in, and triggers that prevent deletion on opportunities I do not want to delete.
3. Apex Classes that wire in Salesforce org data to my LWC.
4. An experience site, with a log in flow.

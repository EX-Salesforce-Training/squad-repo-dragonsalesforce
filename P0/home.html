            <article> The ageless wonder, Max Scherzer, has won the National League Cy Young, the fourth of his career.
              The
              37 year
              old,
              dropped
              236 strikeouts, a 3.38 era, 16 wins, and a 6.3 WAR. Max Scherzer has been elite for years now, this is his
              9th
              top 5 Cy Young
              finish in his career. People are wondering how long until he falls off, the Rockets are hoping that
              father
              time lays off for a while.
              The 37 year old still has another 4 years on contract. We asked his agent Scott Boras what he thinks about
              his
              clients
              performance,
              but he was too busy bathing in money.

              Young Slugger Juan Soto wins the National League's most valuable player award. Soto slashed 40 homeruns, a
              batting
              average of .340, and an obp of .465.
              The 23 year old finally gets his award, after finishing top 10 for an award every year of his career. His
              2018,
              and 2021 2nd place finishes upset many nationals fans, but no one
              will complain about this finish. The 23 year old Dominican superstar is expected to resign with the world
              champian
              Washington Nationals this offseason.
              We tried to ask his agent Scott Boras for comment, but he was busy partying on Jeff Bezos yacht.

              The 2022 Washington Nationals have won the World Series. Just like 2019, they started as a wild card, with
              almost
              no one
              believing they could compete with the big boys. They were able to fight all the way to another pennet, and
              eventually beating the
              Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Playoff, and World Series MVP Carter Kieboom slashed a .380 average,
              and
              4
              total homeruns in the
              playoffs. We asked asked 78 year old White Sox manager Tony LaRussa about the loss, but he was too busy
              complaining about no one
              following the unwritten rules anymore.

              The Rockville Rockets had high hopes coming into the 2022 season. Their owner wanted results fast, spending
              more
              on Free Agency than
              anyone else. The team put up a disapointing 76 and 86 record. They had great players
              putting
              up
              4
              plus war seasons, however,
              a few players really brought the team down. Yuli Gurriel and Brian Anderson had very disapointing seasons,
              both
              playing much worse
              than replacement. One piece of defense that the team could use is that they were the most unlucky team in
              baseball. They had a
              negetive 7 pythagorean win differential, which means they won 7 less games than they were mathmatically
              supposed
              to. If they win those games,
              they could've stolen the wild card spot from the Mets. The future of the team is questionable, with most of
              their
              talent getting old, and
              their best hitter, Kris Bryant, demanding a trade.

              Rockville Rockets third baseman Kris Bryant has demanded a trade. He was very disapointed in their 2022
              season,
              and does not like
              the direction that the team is heading. The 31 year old wants to play for a contender, and with his contract
              not
              expiring until 2026,
              he does not want to wait until free agency. We asked Scott Boras for a comment, and he said "I do not care
              about
              this
              client anymore,
              hit me up when he is a free agent again".

              Before the 2022 season, no one was expecting Andrelton Simmons to get more than a minor league contract.
              However,
              the upstart Rockville Rockets decided to
              shock the world and offered the 32 year old defensive legend a three year contract. This contract was
              heavily
              criticized at the time, but no one is questioning them now.
              The Curacao native put up a 4.3 war season, the second best of all shortstops in 2022, just behind Trea
              Turner.
              What
              changed this year?, his bat. His defensive ability was
              not the question, the 4 time gold glover is the favorite to win this years, aswell. He was able to make good
              contact again, becoming a well above replacement hitter,
              slashinga .252 average. We asked Andrelton Simmons about his comeback season, and he said "Thanks".

              Aaron Judge cannot catch a break. The injury riddled Bronx bomber finally had a healthy season in 2021, but
              he
              will not
              see the field in 2022. Judge tore his pcl, mcl, acl, labrum, pectoral, bicep, and tricep, in a freak lawn
              mowing
              accident.
              The video of the injury from his property in Middlesex New Jersey has been making the rounds on social
              media,
              however, we will
              warn that it is very disturbing. Yankees fan 27RingsWeAreTheBest left this comment on youtube, "I did not
              know
              a
              human leg could,
              bend like that, may God have mercy on his soul". Aaron Judge is expecting to be on recovery for the next
              10 to 12 months.

              The Rockville Rockets were very busy this off season, picking up two veteran pitchers to lead their young
              squad.
              Zach Grienke,
              one of those veterans, shockingly retired last night. The future hall of famer, after long conversations
              with
              family,
              decided that it was best to hang up his cleats. He was mainly thinking about his health, if he had another
              major
              arm injury, it could
              affect him the rest of his life. ZacK Grienke had this to say, "After long deliberation with my wife and the
              rest
              of my family, I have
              come to the conclusion that I will retire at once. I was very much looking forward to the upcoming season
              with
              the Rockville Rockets,
              however I am looking at my future. 38 may be an old man in baseball, but I still have much of my life left.
              If
              I
              get one more major arm
              injury, I may be incapacitated the rest of my life. I want to live a long healthy life with my wife and
              kids,
              and
              that is my number one
              goal, not playing baseball. I wish the Rockville Rockets and their new owner the best". The Rockville
              Rockets
              plan
              to use Braxton Garrett
              to fill the hole left by Grienke.

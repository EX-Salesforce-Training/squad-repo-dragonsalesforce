            <article class="slds-p-horizontal_small">Please take a trip to our newly built Gordy Coleman Memorial Stadium.
              Located in
              beautiful downtown Rockville, on the site of the old little league fields at Dogwood Park, at 800 Monroe St,
              Rockville, MD 20852. Gordy Coleman Memorial Stadium was modeled to be extremely similar to the Polo Grounds,
              the
              old
              Brooklyn Dodgers Stadium. However, the dimensions where changed to make it more modern. The distance from
              the
              foulpoles to
              homeplate were extended by 40 feet, while the distance from homeplate to deep center is now 430 feet. These
              dimensions are still
              kept a little extreme both to keep that Polo Grounds feel, and to have the ability to convert the field for
              football games.
              Make sure you try out the delicious food in our stadium, each vendor is represented by local business. Try
              out
              our Meta Virtual Reality booths to see if you could get a hit off a Max Scherzer. Check out the Rockville
              Rockets
              hall
              of fame, it currently only holds relics from our time in Miami, but we are sure Rockville will have its own
              very soon. </article>

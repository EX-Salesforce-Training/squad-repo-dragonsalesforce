app.js imports every html file outside of app.html
home.html is set to be displayed by default
every html file has a menu area with buttons and an input field that allow the user to navigate through every page
if a search term entered into the input field does not match one of the allowed pages, it defaults to the searchErr.html and prompts the user to try again
